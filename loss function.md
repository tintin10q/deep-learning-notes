# The loss function
This is the function that decides at the end of the network what the error is. It is mapped on the vector of differences in the expected output and the output. Different loss functions give different results. Also, because this is the final function on the outside of all the train rule derivatives when doing back propagation. 

The loss function is also called the objective function. Less formally is the error or cost function
